The misunderstanding

The goal : - to destroy the enemy troops and be victorious.

Rules : - select  one type of troop on your side and its attack and click the enemy's troop which you desire to destroy.

​             Remember that you can only select two troops to attack.

​            after you are done selecting press the done button to play your moves.

​            NOTE! each troop has different hp (HITPOINTS) so remember to play wisely.

​            After a specific amount of damage dealt, you would be able to unlock power ups (shield or the fighter planes)

​           The shield power up can be only applied to one troop only so select the troop wisely as per ups can be only                     used once

​           the fighterplanes power up is simillar but it deals damage to the opponent  that you have selected

Feedback 

each troop has different hp (HITPOINTS) so remember to play wisely.

the leader has to have a textbox beside it.



adaptivity

the first level would be like a tuturial of the game mechanics but stage two will be more difficult as there will be more troops which will attack you but it will not be so difficult that you will not be able to win the game.
